quib-console.js
================

This is a javascript HTML5 canvas console based on code taken from
the excellent qb.js (http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=92).
I'm working on it primarily for nostalgia purposes, as I used to
program text games in QBasic using code page 437.

I'm intending to support printing all characters from code page 437.
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437

In particular, qb.js does not support smiley characters, which I
have added!
